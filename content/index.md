# Index

Welcome to Rustmark!

This is the index page. Its title is somewhat optional, as the main application
title will be used when viewing through Rustmark. It's recommended to still add
a title though, for niceness when previewing the file using a Git server or
other Markdown viewer.

Add what you want here. Usually that would be an introduction to your project,
and a list of links to other pages.

## Pages

  - [Features](rustmark/features.md) - A page showing supported Markdown
    features, with examples.
  - [Guidelines](rustmark/guidelines.md) - Guidelines for writing Markdown
    documents and structuring the `content` directory.
